# ProjectDeepLearning
This Project is made of C++.
And the purpose is to learn how deep learning mechanism works.
Currently, it is based on MLP, using SVM loss function,
and optimizes via gradient descent.

==How to Use==

1. Choose which dataset to use
2. Choose whether use validation set or not
3. Choose whether load previous weights or not
(Here, alpha is the number of layers and its minimum value is 1)
4. Choose whether input your own hyperparameter values or not
5. During training, you can input some commends (input h and enter for help)
6. Your trained weight parameters are saved at "TrainedParam" file.
