# ProjectDeepLearning

This Project is made of C++.
And the purpose is to learn how deep learning mechanism works.
Currently, it is based on MLP, using SVM loss function,
and optimizes via momentum update.
It doesn't support cuda yet.
Next goal is to add convolutional layers
and cuda supporting.

==How to Use==

0. Call "PDL.exe (saved file name)" in console to load previous file
   or call "PDL.exe" in console to start newly.
   You can just execute saved files directly in Windows GUI.
1. Choose which dataset to use.
2. Choose whether use validation set or not.
3. Input your file's name if you're starting for the first time.
4. Choose hyperparameter to change its values or not.
5. During training, you can input some commends (input h and enter for help)
6. Input 'q' to end the program.
