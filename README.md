# ProjectDeepLearning
This Project is made of C++
to learn how deep learning mechanism works.
Currently, it is based on MLP, using SVM loss function,
and optimizes via gradient descent.
The program only can read MNIST dataset,
but you can add new functions at "dataread.cpp"
to load more libraries.

==How to Use==

1. Choose which dataset to use
2. Choose whether use validation set or not
3. Choose whether load previous weights or not
4. Choose whetherinput your own hyperparameter values or not
5. During training, you can input some commends (input h and enter for help)
6. Your trained weight parameters are saved at "TrainedParam" file.
